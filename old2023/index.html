            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>I am a Thai-Taiwanese-Canadian computer science PhD candidate at Dalhousie University. My current work involves using mixed reality (AR/VR)
                to create an interactive machine learning system. I was a sessional lecturer at Dalhousie University, and an Ericsson intern. Previously, I was
                Master's degree student at University of Calgary specializing in computer-assisted language learning. I obtained my Bachelor's degree
                at University of Toronto in computer science, cognitive science, and French.

            <p>Gander is my main PhD project. It is an AR+tablet interface for a multiple linear regression system. This project is partially funded by
                MITACS and Ericsson, Canada. The work has produced the following publication and patent:

            <p>When I was a Master's degree student at University, I developed Kalgan. Kalgan is a web-based video player designed for language learning. I was also an intern
                at Lenovo, Beijing, China. My Master's degree work is published as a poster paper:</p>

            <h1>Honours Bachelor of Science Projects</h1>

            <p>I was a research assistant at TAGLab, at University of Toronto. TAGLab is a lab for using technologies to improve the lives of seniors.
                I was updating with Tangra, an online portal for conducting online studies developd by Velian Pandeliev. I also worked with InTouch and ALLT.
                During the summer of 2013, I was an intern at JetAsia Airways, Bangkok, Thailand.
