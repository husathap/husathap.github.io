        <section id="bio">
        Dr. Hu has recently started his research activities in extended reality (XR) and artificial intelligence (AI) at the beginning of May 2025.
        Currently, he is working with Prof. Muhammad Azam and Meet Shekhada on developing visualization of AI techniques in virtual reality (VR)
        and effective methods of collecting and analyzing user data while they are observing the visualization. <strong>As the work has just begun,
        the lab shall remain nameless for now.

                <p>Currently, the work is exploring how to effectively visualize machine learning techniques using
                extended reality. The work also focuses on effective data collection and analysis to understand
                how the user comprehends the visualization as well as developing understanding of the virtual content
                that they are viewing.</p>

                <h2>Undergraduate Students</h2>
                <p>Currently, there is insufficient funding to hire an additional research assistant. However,
                    if interested, an Algoma University student in an undergraduate honour computer science program may
                    choose to write a honours thesis with Dr. Hu as a reader for credits. If the quality of the thesis justifies publication,
                    Dr. Hu will assist in converting the report into a scientific paper. Alternatively, if you are more interested
                    in programming than research, you may request to work on a project for credits.
                </p>

                <h2>Graduate Students</h2>
                <p>Algoma University has recently launched a new research-based Master's degree program. If you are interested in working
                on Dr. Hu's project, they are encouraged to contact him during the application process. If successful, you will be developing
                a thesis that aligns with Dr. Hu's research interests and goals. You may also ask for co-supervision as well.
                Please note that the funding scheme is still being developed.
                </p>

                <p>If you are a course-based student, there is currently insufficient funding to hire a graduate researcher. 
                    However, you may be able to work in the lab as part of a project course for credits.
                </p>
