                <p>I have just started his research activities in extended reality (XR) and artificial intelligence (AI) at the beginning of May 2025.
                Currently, I am working on developing immersive visualization of AI techniques in virtual reality (VR)
                and effective methods of collecting and analyzing user data while they are observing the visualization. The work here is an extension of my Ph.D. work
                that I have completed at Dalhousie University. It is important to note that while I work with AI, I tend to focus more on that human-centred 
                and the data science aspects of AI.</p>

                as the sole supervisor. <strong>The sole exception is Mitacs Globalink which allows: (1) an international student work in Canada for about a semester or (2) an Algoma University
                student to work at a foreign university for a semester. The are limited spots, so any interested student <em>must</em> contact me for more information.

                <p>If you are a current Algoma University student, I can act as your supervisor or an examiner for your thesis or project course. Although these positions are
                unpaid, you can earn your course credits. If our interests align, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. The types of credits that you can earn will depend
                on your current program.

                <p>Currently, Algoma University offers a thesis-based Master's degree program in computer science. However, a successful student can only with a professor
                who has a grant. I am currently not holding any grant or award. As such, I will not be able to supervise you as a sole supervisor.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, there are other researchers in Canada who work in similar areas as mine. I highly suggest reaching out to the following professors: 
                Mayra Barrera Machuca, Sheelagh Carpendale, Pourang Irani, Derek Reilly, Wolfgang Stuerlingerz, and more.</p>
