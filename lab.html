                <p>I have just started his research activities in extended reality (XR) and artificial intelligence (AI) at the beginning of May 2025.
                Currently, I am working on developing immersive visualization of AI techniques in virtual reality (VR)
                and effective methods of collecting and analyzing user data while they are observing the visualization. The work here is an extension of my Ph.D. work
                that I have completed at Dalhousie University. It is important to note that while I work with AI, I tend to focus more on that human-centred 
                and the data science aspects of AI.</p>

                <h2 class="title is-2"> Collaborators</h2>

                <p>Currently, I am collaborating with:</p>
                    
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prof. Muhammad Azam:</strong> An assistant professor at Algoma University.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prof. Somang Nam:</strong> An assistant professor at Algoma University.</li>
                    <li><strong>Harris Adedeji:</strong> An undergraduate research assistant at Algoma University.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>From Apr 2025 until Aug 2025, I was working with:</p>
                    
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prof. Muhammad Azam:</strong> An assistant professor at Algoma University.</li>

                <h1 class="title is-2">Prospective Student Researcher</h1>
                
                <p class="notification is-danger">Currently, due to limited funding, I am not able to provide any paid position to any student. This includes all research opportunities. 
                    Furthermore,
                since Algoma University does not allow students to self-fund their research-based Master's degree, I am not able to supervise any research-based student
                as the sole supervisor. <strong>Exception: I may be able to fund Mitacs Globalink student researchers; please read more.</strong>
                </p>

                <h2 class="title is-3">Mitacs Globalink Student Exchange</h2>

                <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-internship-students/">Mitacs Globalink</a> provides some supports for exchange students. 
                This allows an Algoma University professor to do one of the following:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Outbound Exchange:</strong> Sending a current Algoma University student to work as a research intern at another foreign university.
                    Both undergraduate and graduate students here are eligible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inbound Exchange:</strong> Receiving a foreign student to work as a research intern at Algoma Univeristy.</li>
                </ul>

                As the application process is highly individualized, to get started, a student interested in a research opportunity should contact me or 
                other professors that they would like to work with. The student must keep in mind of the following:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Having Some Idea:</strong> The student will need to write a letter of intent. This means, they should have some idea on what
                    they want to do. Before contacting me, they should ensure that their research interests overlap with mind.</li>
                    <li><strong>Long Application Time:</strong> The application must be submitted to Mitacs at least 16 weeks before the first day.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2 class="title is-3">Current Algoma University Students</h2>

                <p>If you are a current Algoma University student, I can act as your supervisor or an examiner for your thesis or project course. Although these positions are
                unpaid, you can earn your course credits. If our interests align, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. The types of credits that you can earn will depend
                on your current program.

                                        you may choose to complete a Bachelor's thesis or computing project with me. A thesis is beneficial to those who are
                                    applying for graduate school. Meanwhile, a computing project is more oriented towards students who want to build their portfolios.
                                    If you are wondering which options to take, please consult the calendar your advisor for more information.</p>

                <p>Currently, Algoma University offers a thesis-based Master's degree program in computer science. However, a successful student can only with a professor
                who has a grant. I am currently not holding any grant or award. As such, I will not be able to supervise you as a sole supervisor.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, there are other researchers in Canada who work in similar areas as mine. I highly suggest reaching out to the following professors: 
                Mayra Barrera Machuca, Sheelagh Carpendale, Pourang Irani, Derek Reilly, Wolfgang Stuerlingerz, and more.</p>
