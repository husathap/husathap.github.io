      <h3>InTouch</h3>
      <strong>From: January 2015 - September 2015</strong><br />
      <strong>Website: <a href="https://www.taglab.toronto.edu/index.php/projects/intouch-technologies-to-combat-social-isolation-and-loneliness/"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span></a></strong>
      <p>
        InTouch is an iOS app designed for seniors and people in their circles of care. It allows seniors to communicate with
        people in their circles. What makes this app special is that it has been designed with user-centric design philosophy.
        This means the app has been tested out with seniors themselves. Currently, my role is to be a developer. However,
        I started as a tester.

      <h3>ALLT</h3>
      <strong>From: June 2015 - September 2015</strong><br />
      <strong>Website: <a href="https://www.taglab.toronto.edu/index.php/projects/simple-project/"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span></a></strong>
      <p>
        ALLT or Accessible Large-print Listening and Talking is an Android app that features various tools to facilitate eBooks
        reading. One of its important features is the ability to make recording out from the reading. During the recording,
        the users can be facilitate through word or sentence highlighting. However, it is not known which parameters for
        highlighting is the best. Therefore, several parameters are going to be tested. My job is to stabilize and upgrade a modified
        version of the app for experimentation.

      <h3>Tangra</h3>
      <strong>From: September 2014 - June 2015</strong><br />
      <strong>Website: <a href="https://www.taglab.toronto.edu/index.php/projects/tangra-defining-and-supporting-online-studies-and-randomized-controlled-trials/"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span></a></strong>
      <p>
        Tangra is Velian Pendeliev's Master's degree thesis. It is a Django web portal that allows researchers to perform
        social experiments outside the lab. My task is to upgrade the engine so that it can be later adapted into studies
        done in TAGLab.
