                            Hello, I am currently a Student Research Trainee at TAGLab at University of Toronto.
                            My current works involving tesing and develping mobile apps for senior. The lab is
                            supervised by Prof. Ronald Baecker. I will be doing my Master's degree at University
                            of Calgary from September of 2015.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My area of specialty in computer science is Human-Computer Interaction. However, I also
                            have background in computational linguistics and machine learning.

                        <p>
                            I started working in this lab as my 4th year computer science capstone. However, my
                            involvement eventually evolved into a part-time position for software evaluation.
                            Now, I am working full-time as a summer intern as a developer/tester.

                            I worked mainly as an administrator fo the airlines. At the same time, I was also

                        <p>
                            My bachelor is a widely interdisciplinary program. In the end, I have done a specialist in
                            computer science, a major in cognitive science and a minor in French. During my career at
                            University of Toronto, I have been under the supervision of Prof. John Vervaeke, Velian Pandeliev
                            and Prof. Ronald Baecker.

                            InTouch is an iOS app designed for seniors and people in their circles of care. It allows seniors to communicate with
                            people in their circles. What makes this app special is that it has been designed with user-centric design philosophy.
                            This means the app has been tested out with seniors themselves. Currently, my role is to be a developer. However,
                            I started as a tester.

                            ALLT or Accessible Large-print Listening and Talking is an Android app that features various tools to facilitate eBooks
                            reading. One of its important features is the ability to make recording out from the reading. During the recording,
                            the users can be facilitate through word or sentence highlighting. However, it is not known which parameters for
                            highlighting is the best. Therefore, several parameters are going to be tested. My job is to stabilize and upgrade a modified
                            version of the app for experimentation.

                            Tangra is Velian Pendeliev's Master's degree thesis. It is a Django web portal that allows researchers to perform
                            social experiments outside the lab. My task is to upgrade the engine so that it can be later adapted into studies
                            done in TAGLab.
