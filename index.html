            <p><i class="bi bi-person-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> I am a PhD candidate at GEMLab, Dalhousie University, under the supervision of Derek Reilly.
            My specialization includes augmented reality, information visualization, and human-computer interaction. Furthermore,
            I have experience in UI design, data science, and web development. I was also a MITACS intern at Ericsson from
            2020 to 2021. I am an alumnus of the University of Calgary (MSc) and the University of Toronto (HBSc).</p>

            <p>Currently, my technology stack is: Unity, MRTK, C#, HTML, R, Python, and Microsoft Office. However, I also worked
                with other technologies in the past (eg. Django, Visual Basic, Android, and iOS development). I also have
                some knowledge in cognitive science, computer-assisted language learning, and development for seniors from my
                experience before my PhD program.
