        <h1><span>About Me</span></h1>

        <p>I am a PhD student at Dalhousie University under the supervision of Prof. Derek Reilly. I am also concurrently holding a 
        MITACS Accelerate intern position at Ericsson. My specialization is in the
        areas of cross reality and statistics. Occassionally, I teach university classes and provide data science services.</p>

        <p>Previously, I was a MSc student at the University of Calgary under the supervision of Prof. Wesley Willett. My topic
        was about computer-assisted language learning. I was an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. My programs were
        specialist in computer science, major in cognitive science, and minor in French as a second language.
